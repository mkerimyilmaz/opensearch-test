== Installation

This page guides you through the installation process of the client.

Requirements:

* Java 8 or later. The library provides high-level type-safe classes 
  and methods for all {es} APIs. It sits on top of the 
  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/java-rest-low.htm8l[Low Level Rest Client] 
  that manages all http communications.
 
* The JSON implementation used by the Java client is pluggable and you must add 
  a JSON object mapping library as a dependency to your project. It has support 
  for https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson] or a 
  http://json-b.net/[JSON-B] library like 
  https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/yasson[Eclipse Yasson].


The GA releases are hosted on Maven Central. Snapshot versions are hosted on 
https://snapshots.elastic.co/maven/[Elastic's Maven snapshot repository].

=== Installation in a Maven project by using Jackson

In the `pom.xml` of your project, add the following repository definition and 
dependencies:

```
<project>

  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>Elastic-Snapshots</id>
      <url>https://snapshots.elastic.co/maven</url>
      <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </snapshots>
      </repository>
  </repositories>

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>co.elastic.clients</groupId>
      <artifactId>elasticsearch-java</artifactId>
      <version>7.15.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>

[[compatibility]]
=== Compatibility

The `main` branch targets the next major release (8.0), the `7.x` branch targets 
the next minor release. Support is still incomplete as the API code is generated 
from the {es} Specification that is also still a work in progress.

The {es} Java client is forward compatible; meaning that the client supports 
communicating with greater or equal minor versions of {es}. Elastic language clients are 
also backwards compatible with lesser supported minor {es} versions.
