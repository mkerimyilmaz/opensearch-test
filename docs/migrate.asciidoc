== Migrating from the High Level Rest Client

The {es} Java API Client is an entirely new client library that has no relation 
to the older High Level Rest Client (HLRC). This was a deliberate choice to 
provide a library that is independent from the {es} server code and that 
provides a very consistent and easier to use API for all {es} features.

Migrating from the HLRC therefore requires some code rewrite in your 
application. This transition can however happen progressively as the two client 
libraries can coexist in a single application with no operational overhead.

=== Transition strategies

There are different ways you can start transitioning away from the HLRC in your 
application code.

For example:

* keep the existing code as-is and use the new Java API Client for new features 
  in your application, then later migrate the existing code,
* rewrite the parts of your application where the new Java API Client is much 
  easier to use than that of the HLRC, like everything related to search,
* rewrite those parts where you need to map application objects to/from JSON, by 
  leveraging the tight integration of the new Java API Client with JSON object 
  mappers.

=== Using the same transport with the HLRC and the Java API Client

To avoid any operational overhead during the transition phase where an 
application would use both the HLRC and the new Java API Client, both clients 
can share the same Low Level Rest Client, which is the network layer that 
manages all connections, round-robin strategies, node sniffing, and so on.

The code below shows how to initialize both clients with the same HTTP client:

["source","java"]
--------------------------------------------------
// Create the low-level client
RestClientBuilder httpClientBuilder = RestClient.builder(
    new HttpHost("localhost", 9200)
);

// Create the HLRC
RestHighLevelClient hlrc = new RestHighLevelClient(httpClientBuilder);

// Create the new Java Client with the same low level client
Transport transport = new RestClientTransport(
    hlrc.getLowLevelClient(),
    new JacksonJsonpMapper()
);

ElasticsearchClient esClient = new ElasticsearchClient(transport);

// hlrc and esClient share the same httpClient
--------------------------------------------------
