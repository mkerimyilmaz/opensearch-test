/**
 * This class represents an immutable product version, as specified in
 * <a href="https://github.com/elastic/clients-team/blob/master/knowledgebase/specifications/client-meta-header.md#registries">
 *     Structured HTTP Header for Client Metadata</a>.
 *
 * In that specification it is stated that a version string must match
 * the following regex:
 *     <code>^[0-9]{1,2}\.[0-9]{1,2}(?:\.[0-9]{1,3})?p?$</code>.
 *
 * Therefore, the following rules are encoded within this class:
 *
 * 1. The major and minor versions are mandatory and can be any value
 *    between 0 and 99 inclusive. It is unstated in the specification,
 *    but the assumption is made that leading zeros do not affect the
 *    value of the field, i.e. "05" is equal to "5". Values outside
 *    the range 0..99 will throw an exception.
 * 2. The maintenance version is optional can be any value between
 *    0 and 999 inclusive. As above, it is assumed that leading zeros
 *    do not affect the field value, and values outside the given
 *    range will throw an exception. To model optionality, the special
 *    value -1 can be used to denote omission.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://github.com/elastic/dev/blob/main/releases/time_based_releases.md#versioning">
